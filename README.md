Santa's list of good IDG1100 students

## Reflection
> Was able to get my name on the website in the end.
> Don't think the changes I did to the .conf file was necessary.
> Also unsure if I did the git clone/pull processs correctly, as it says "This branch is 1 commit ahead, 2 commits behind aliakseix:master" above my fork.
> Had to do a forced push, which would be quite risky if I collaborated with others.
> Hopefully, the final result of this Lab was not to make the index.sh appear through the index.html somehow.
> Sorry if it was though, not sure how to do that lmao
> Just sending a pull request because the Lab says so, even though I probably did everything wrong!

> The histories' of our projects  were too conflicting, trying to re-do it.
